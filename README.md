# Data-Analytics_ML_portfolio
## projects
There are Five (5) different projects in this porfolio
# DA project1
Description: Its a python data analytics work where one has to determine if increasing the production of "repeat product" comodity could lead to increase in sales based on the analysis of the current data
# EEG Emotion data classification project
Description of dataset:
The dataset is an EEG dataset obtained from Muse head band during an experiment where different videos eliciting various emotional states were played. The participants were one male and one female while the emotional states annotated were Neutral, Positive and Negative. The data was recorded at 3 minutes per state using the Muse static electrodes: AF7, AF8, TP9, TP10. 
Several mathematical and statistical features have been generated from the data according to works of these researchers [] for more information (https://github.com/jordan-bird/eeg-feature-generation) . Hence, no new feature was added to this data, but several machine learning and deep learning techniques were implemented to evaluate their accuracy in classifying these emotional states. The sampling rate of the Muse is 256Hz.
# dwa project
Description:
This project requires the cleaning and preprocessing of a very messy big data about football players and numerous features that can be used to predict their scoring chances in a match. The data is cleaned, preprocesed and useful features were extracted and used in a machine learning algorithm to predict chances of scoring in a match. Its a very challenging data and more work can be done to improve the prediction. 
# autodirty data set
This is a very messy data about automobiles. the data is cleaned and prepared for machine learning exploration 
# Heart disease ML-EDA
I did exploratory analysis for the popular heart disease data set for better understanding of the data and subsequent develpoment of machine learning problem that could be solved with the data
