# DA project1
Description: Its a python data analytics work where one has to determine if increasing the production of "repeat product" comodity could lead to increase in sales based on the analysis of the current data
# Description of dataset:
The dataset is an EEG dataset obtained from Muse head band during an experiment where different videos eliciting various emotional states were played. The participants were one male and one female while the emotional states annotated were Neutral, Positive and Negative. The data was recorded at 3 minutes per state using the Muse static electrodes: AF7, AF8, TP9, TP10. 
Several mathematical and statistical features have been generated from the data according to works of these researchers [] for more information (https://github.com/jordan-bird/eeg-feature-generation) . Hence, no new feature was added to this data, but several machine learning and deep learning techniques were implemented to evaluate their accuracy in classifying these emotional states. The sampling rate of the Muse is 256Hz.
